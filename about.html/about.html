        <p>Welcome to my fashion illustration blog! My name is Zinhle Ngubane, and I'm passionate about Haute Couture, video game illustration design, and costume design.</p>
        
        <p>I graduated from Fashion School in 2016 and have been illustrating since 2012. Over the years, I have experimented with various mediums including Adobe Illustrator for digital illustrations, traditional hand-drawn techniques, and more recently, incorporating AI technology in my creative process.</p>
        
        <p>This blog is a showcase of my latest artworks, insights into my creative process, and the stories behind each piece. Whether you're interested in high fashion, video game aesthetics, or historical costume design, I hope my work inspires and captivates your imagination.</p>
